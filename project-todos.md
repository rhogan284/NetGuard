# Project To-Do List

1. **Fix Flask app Redis connection:**
   - Issue: The Flask app doesn't seem to be recognizing blocked IPs correctly.
   - Action: Review both the Flask app (`web/app.py`) and the Threat Responder (`threat_detector/threat_responder.py`) to ensure they're using the same Redis configuration and key names.
   - Specific checks:
     - Verify that the `REDIS_URL` and `BLOCKED_IPS_KEY` are consistent across both files.
     - Ensure that the Redis client in the Flask app is properly initialized and connected.
     - Add error handling and logging for Redis operations in the Flask app.

2. **Implement proper error handling:**
   - Add try-except blocks for database operations in `web/app.py`.
   - Implement better error handling in `threat_detector/threat_detector.py` and `threat_detector/threat_responder.py`.

3. **Improve logging:**
   - Standardize logging across all components (web app, threat detector, threat responder).
   - Ensure that all important events and errors are properly logged.

4. **Enhance security measures:**
   - Implement input validation and sanitization in the Flask app to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
   - Use parameterized queries for all database operations.

5. **Optimize performance:**
   - Review and optimize Elasticsearch queries in both the threat detector and responder.
   - Consider implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.

6. **Update dependencies:**
   - Review and update all Python dependencies to their latest stable versions.
   - Ensure compatibility between updated packages.

7. **Implement unit tests:**
   - Create unit tests for critical functions in all components.
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically.

8. **Enhance Docker configuration:**
   - Review and optimize Dockerfiles for all services.
   - Implement health checks for all services in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

9. **Improve configuration management:**
   - Consider using environment variables for sensitive information instead of hardcoding them in config files.
   - Implement a centralized configuration management system.

10. **Enhance threat detection rules:**
    - Review and update threat detection rules in `threat_detector/detector_config.yaml`.
    - Consider implementing machine learning-based threat detection for more advanced protection.

11. **Implement rate limiting:**
    - Add rate limiting functionality to the Flask app to prevent abuse.

12. **Improve documentation:**
    - Create comprehensive documentation for the project setup, configuration, and maintenance.
    - Add inline comments to complex parts of the code.

13. **Implement monitoring and alerting:**
    - Set up a monitoring system to track the health and performance of all components.
    - Implement an alerting system for critical issues.

14. **Review and optimize Logstash configuration:**
    - Ensure that Logstash is properly configured to handle the log volume.
    - Optimize Logstash filters for better performance.

15. **Implement data retention policies:**
    - Set up data retention policies for logs and threat data in Elasticsearch.

Remember to prioritize these tasks based on their impact and urgency for your specific project needs.
